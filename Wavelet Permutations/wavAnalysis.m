%% Permutations with Multiple Comparison Corrections
%Here, we will correct multiple comparisons as derived in the last sections
%We will be doing this in two ways (your choice what to use)
% 1)Looking at individual voxels
% 2)Looking at cluster sizes

%% Permutation of Individual Voxels
%Create Null Distribution

%Determine Min/Max Z-Values of Each Permutation
for perms = 1:n_permutations %Cycle through number of permutations
    temp = squeeze(permmaps(perms,:,:)); %Extract current permutation
    max_vals(perms,:) = [min(temp(:)) max(temp(:))]; %Extracts min and max Z-Values
end

%Determine the Voxel Z-Crit Cutoffs
thresh_lo = prctile(max_vals(:,1),100*(alpha_value/2)); %Determine low cutoff
thresh_hi = prctile(max_vals(:,2),100-(100*(alpha_value/2))); %Determine high cutoff

zmap_voxel = WAV_diff; %Carry over the difference data into something we can manipulate
zmap_voxel(zmap_voxel>thresh_lo & zmap_voxel < thresh_hi) = 0; %If specific voxels are as extreme or more extreme than cutoffs, then change them to zero
%zmap_voxel = vec2mat(zmap_voxel,time_length); %Last step turns it into a vector, so turn it back into a matrix

%% Plotting Voxel Permutation Results
%Please note: Here I simply plot the values that are significant, but in manuscripts I suggest you rather put contour lines around significant portions of your original data.

    threshimg = (threshimg - mean_h0)./std_h0; %Standardize the permutation

        max_cluster_sizes(perms) = max(tempclustsize); %Extracts the largest cluster size of this permutation
    end
end

%Determine significance of clusters
